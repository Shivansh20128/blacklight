# Blacklight Assignment
This is Blacklight assignment for making APIs and hosting them.

The code contains all the necessary files.

## Calling the APIs
1. You can call the first API and get the current week leaderboard on this link:

2. You can call the second API using this link (getting last week leaderboard given a country)
https://blacklight-task.onrender.com/API/country/:COUNTRY

3. You the call the third API and get the rank of a player given the UID using this link.

# Database
The database has been hosted on clever-cloud.com. The sql query used for generating the database has been provided here. The database has been generated using a random generator tool.

If you face some problem getting the output for some query, you can manually use the queries provided in the queries.js file and the data output. I have tested all the queries and they are working perfectly.
